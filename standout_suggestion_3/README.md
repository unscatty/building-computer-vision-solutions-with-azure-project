For this I created a Flask API application running on Azure App Service, which can be accessed at https://automated-boarding-kiosk-validator.azurewebsites.net

For the frontend I created a Vue SPA using Vuetify to simulate the Boarding Kiosk website, which can be accessed at https://azureaiblob.z13.web.core.windows.net/

These two projects are in their own repository to watch their progress
